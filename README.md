TAMID Template

Hey! Here is a template for all TAMID organizations to make a basic one-page website. Easy to implement with a little css!

just need to put the contents in your root directory folder for your TAMID website, change the email address on the mail.php file, replace the three asterisks (***) with your school name, change the school colors and pictures in the css file, and add whatever content you want to the index.html file. I would appreciate different pictures, check out this link to find great and free stock photos (https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b) Let me know if you guys have any questions! Anyone with basic HTML and CSS knowledge should be able to implement it easily.
